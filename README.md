# ToDoList
Modiifying the w3schools version of their toDoList using base Javascript and no libraries. I'm reteaching myself Javascript and going through different problems and adding features to each problem. 
Attempting to add a timer to each of the events and improving the existing code

Was able to recreate adding and deleting li from base script. 
Added a timer which later one would like to add one for each li added to the list

Currently the script is in its basic form. 


IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD BE MADE
1. Adding timers to each item added to a list
2. Having todos 'expire' based on a time limit
3. More effort into the overrall CSS


LONG TERM
1. Score each task based on how much time it took and create a machine learning problem that can be used to decide how much time should be used on each task. 
2. Faster implementation.
